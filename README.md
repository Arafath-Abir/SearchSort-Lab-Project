Search & Sort Algorithms in C

A modular C project that demonstrates fundamental searching and sorting techniques.
The project is designed for learning, practice, and showcasing clean, reusable implementations of classic algorithms.

🚀 Algorithms Implemented
🔍 Searching

Linear Search – Simple scan of an array.

Binary Search – Efficient search on sorted arrays (auto-sorts input before searching).

📊 Sorting

Bubble Sort – Repeated swapping of adjacent elements.

Quick Sort – Divide & conquer with partitioning.

Insertion Sort – Build a sorted list one element at a time.

Merge Sort – Divide & conquer with merging.

Selection Sort – Repeatedly pick the smallest element.
